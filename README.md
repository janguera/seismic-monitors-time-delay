Modelling problem: 
In order to study the behavior and composition of the underground floor, drilling companies need precise timing and positioning information of their equipments. Those equipments are link in a network and are generally connected to a global positioning system for synchronization. However there are no guarantee that the instruments will remain synchronized and some of them my deviate in time. Hence, the periods to which the vibration of the underground floor are caught might not be completely accurate, making the precise localisation of the events impossible. The goal of this project is to model the effect of de-synchronization between the different instruments and how the de-syncrhonization events can be detected from the recorded signal logs.
